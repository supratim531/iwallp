          <ul className="list-inside [&>li>strong]:text-primary-light [&>li]:list-inside [&>li]:list-disc">
            <li>
              <strong>Will and Succession Issues:</strong> NRIs often face
              challenges in executing or contesting wills, especially when legal
              heirs are scattered or documents are unclear.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legal System Delays:</strong> Navigating the Indian legal
              system from abroad can be time-consuming and complex due to
              backlog and procedural delays.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Power of Attorney Misuse:</strong> Misuse of POA by
              trusted persons is a common issue that can result in fraudulent
              property transfers or financial loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Title and Ownership Disputes:</strong> NRIs frequently
              struggle to establish or protect land ownership due to poor
              documentation or encroachments.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Property Disputes & Inheritance:</strong> Partition of
              ancestral property, unclear titles, or disputes among co-owners
              can delay or obstruct rightful claims.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Property Management Issues:</strong> Managing property
              from abroad is challenging without reliable local assistance and
              often results in poor maintenance or disputes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Illegal Possession and Encroachment:</strong> Vacant or
              unmonitored property is prone to illegal occupation by tenants,
              relatives, or third parties.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Property Sale Challenges:</strong> Selling property
              remotely involves navigating legal formalities, ensuring correct
              valuation, and avoiding fraudulent buyers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Real Estate Scams:</strong> NRIs are often targeted by
              fraudulent developers or agents promising non-existent or disputed
              properties.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Agricultural Land Restrictions:</strong> Certain Indian
              states restrict non-agriculturists (including NRIs) from
              purchasing agricultural land, leading to legal complications.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Managing Time Zones and Physical Distance:</strong> Legal
              proceedings and documentation require frequent coordination, which
              is tough due to time zone differences and travel limitations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Understanding Complex Laws:</strong> Laws like FEMA, the
              Benami Act, and real estate regulations require professional
              guidance for compliance and interpretation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Handling Extensive Legal Documentation:</strong> NRIs
              often struggle with notarization, attestation, and document
              submission required in Indian legal processes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Risk of Unreliable Local Contacts:</strong> Many NRIs
              depend on relatives or local agents who may not act in their best
              interests, leading to delays or fraud.
