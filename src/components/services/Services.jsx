                  Mediation: A Collaborative Approach to Dispute Resolution
                </strong>
                <br />
                <br />
                Mediation offers a less formal alternative compared to
                arbitration. In mediation, parties collaborate with a mediator,
                a facilitator, to achieve a mutually acceptable agreement. This
                process, characterized by its non-adversarial nature, allows
                parties to preserve their relationships while seeking
                resolution. Unlike arbitration, mediation outcomes are not
                legally binding on the parties.
                <br />
                <br />
                In India, various laws mandate attempting mediation before
                resorting to court adjudication, exemplified by the Commercial
                Courts Act, 2015. Additionally, a Mediation Bill proposed in
                2021 aims to formalize mediation laws and is presently under
                parliamentary review.
